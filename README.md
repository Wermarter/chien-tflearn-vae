# chien-tflearn-vae
My implementation of Variational Autoencoder and its variants using TFLearn

Implemented Features:
    + Vanilla VAE with MNIST: display 2D latent space, transition between two images from dataset
:TODO:
    + Conditional VAE, CVAE+GAN, DRAW
    + Fun experiments with AR Face Database
    + Less likely: DRAW+GAN, VAE(Semi-Supervised Learning), VAE+GAN
