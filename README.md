# chien-tflearn-vae
My implementation of Variational Autoencoder and its variants using TFLearn





Implemented Features:

    + Vanilla VAE: show 2D latent space, image transition, reconstruction
    + Conditional VAE: conditional generation, better reconstruction, style transfer


:TODO:

    + CVAE+GAN, DRAW
    + Fun experiments with AR Face Database
    + Less likely to do: DRAW+GAN, VAE(Semi-Supervised Learning), VAE+GAN
